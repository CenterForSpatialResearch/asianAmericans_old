This is the code for programming the interactive map at https://centerforspatialresearch.github.io/asianAmericans/
You can read the step by step instructions for making this map here: https://medium.com/uncharted-singles/asian-american-dot-density-map-84271a4e68cd
The code is open for your reuse, the data is open as well but should be exported directly from Census data portals.
